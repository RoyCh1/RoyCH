Cruise Control MATLAB
This program is about designing a simple cruise control simulation using MATLAB, SIMULINK, and SIMSCAPE.

We first start by modelling our system using the Second Law of Newton and check the open loop response of our system.
Then, using MATLAB, 5 different methods are used for the control:

1-PID 

2-ROOT LOCUS

3-FREQUENCY

4-STATE-SPACE

5-DIGITAL

Finally, we use SIMULINK and SIMSCAPE to simulate and control the simple cruise-control system.

Start with the MATLAB, then use SIMULINK, and finally SIMSCAPE.
